## 2. End-State Vision

| Axis                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unified Orchestrator**                  | Central controller with exclusive authority to coordinate all phases; roles fully interchangeable between human and autonomous agents.                          |
| **Agentic Flexibility**                   | Clear interfaces allowing any role (codegen, testing, review, etc.) to seamlessly switch between humans, LLMs, or microservices at runtime without refactoring. |
| **Immutable Auditability**                | Tamper-proof logs of every action, decision, override, and state transition, enabling full historical replay and compliance audits.                             |
| **Continuous Meta-Learning**              | Real-time and periodic meta-agent analyses detect bottlenecks, regressions, technical debt, and policy drift, actively enforcing quality standards.             |
| **Universal Applicability**               | Flexible architecture supporting diverse domains (e.g., REIT, analytics, ML, APIs, operations) without special accommodations or workflow changes.              |
| **Transparent Human-Agent Collaboration** | Complete visibility of rationale, state, and handoffs between human and agent roles, maintaining intuitive interaction and trust.                               |

## 3. Strategic Objectives & Key Results (12-month Horizon)

KR1: A fully autonomous agent converts a failing test to green **in safe_inmemory mode** with zero human edits.

| Objective                           | Key Results                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **O1: Launch Robust MVP**           | KR1: Complete one non-trivial end-to-end project delivery (e.g., REIT modeling) with full auditability and agent-human collaboration. |
| **O2: Maximize Velocity**           | KR2: Achieve median task cycle time (selection→commit) ≤1 day; minimum throughput of 5 tasks/week per developer.                      |
| **O3: Ensure Reliability**          | KR3: Zero regressions post-commit; automated gating ensures 100% test pass before merge.                                              |
| **O4: Enable Autonomous Operation** | KR4: Successfully operate at least 3 key workflow phases autonomously per project, logged overrides ≤10%.                             |
| **O5: Continuous Improvement**      | KR5: Real-time analytics on task bottlenecks, rollback frequencies, and failure rates auto-generated and reviewed monthly.            |

## 4. Guiding Principles

1. **Explicit Contracts:** Clear boundaries, single responsibilities, documented and enforced interfaces.
2. **Audit by Default:** Immutable records for transparency, compliance, and learning.
3. **Human Empowerment:** Agents augment humans; overrides are explicitly logged, reviewed, and integrated into learning.
4. **No Hidden State:** All state transitions explicit, serialized, and transparent.
5. **Rapid Feedback & Iteration:** Fail fast, surface clearly, and integrate feedback immediately.
6. **Continuous Meta-Optimization:** Meta-process itself is monitored, self-correcting, and prioritized for improvement.

| **Testing** (`ShellRunner`)                       | Isolated execution of tests, zero side effects     | Test logs, pass/fail                   |
| **Review** (`TaskReviewer`)                       | Audit diff quality, correctness, compliance        | Approval/rejection with rationale      |
| **Commit & Record** (`ShellRunner`, `TaskRecord`) | Persist approved changes, archive state            | Immutable logs and state transitions   |
| **Meta-Review** (`MetaAgent`)                     | Identify workflow improvements, enforce compliance | Actionable improvement reports, alerts |

## 6. Audit, Override & Rollback Policy

* All actions explicitly logged with timestamps, rationales, actors.
* Overrides permitted but logged as exceptions with clear rationales.
* Rollbacks documented with prior state and explicit reason.
* No manual edits outside orchestrator without reconciliation.
