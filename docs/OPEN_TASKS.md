# Open Tasks

## Bootstrap MVP Cadence Platform

* Implement basic `BacklogManager` class with CRUD operations and JSON persistence.
* Develop initial `TaskExecutor` to produce simple unified diffs.
* Build initial `ShellRunner` capable of safely applying diffs, running pytest, and committing changes.
* Integrate `TaskRecord` for initial task state logging.
* Validate basic orchestrator end-to-end via notebook and CLI.

## Autonomous Agent Roles Implementation

* Integrate initial LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) into `TaskGenerator` for generating task descriptions.
* Automate initial code diff generation via LLM-driven `TaskExecutor`.
* Create basic automated review ruleset in `TaskReviewer`.
* Implement autonomous testing in `ShellRunner` leveraging pytest.
* Validate autonomous agent workflow on a controlled test scenario.

## Full Audit and Compliance Infrastructure

* Develop a secure, append-only logging mechanism in `TaskRecord`.
* Implement state serialization ensuring full replayability.
* Test and validate rollback logging explicitly.
* Validate audit replay capability through intentional manual overrides.

## Meta-Agent Continuous Improvement

* Implement initial data collection on task metrics (velocity, failures, rollbacks).
* Develop real-time alerting logic for significant workflow deviations.
* Deliver a prototype monthly improvement report with actionable insights.

## Scalable Multi-Domain Deployment

* Setup initial ML model deployment pipeline orchestrated by Cadence.
* Execute a simple analytics pipeline using Cadence.
* Validate REST API development orchestration including testing and deployment.

## React Frontend Transition

* Setup initial React development environment.
* Develop basic React components for task backlog management.
* Integrate React frontend with Cadence backend APIs.
* Replace Streamlit components with React equivalents.
* Validate frontend-backend integration end-to-end.

## Deferred Tasks (Not permitted in this phase)

* Advanced agent negotiation and collaboration mechanisms.
* Enhanced UI for broader user groups.
* Complex external integrations with third-party systems.
